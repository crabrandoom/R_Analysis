## Linear Regressoin to Predict MPG

The Vehicle length and clearance from the ground both provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model and there is a strong positive correlation.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension

The design specifications require that variance not exceed 100 PSI for eat lot. Overall the lots meet that criteria with a variance of 62. However, when looking at the lots individually, Lot 3 is out of the bounds of the acceptable criteria with a variance of 170.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The P-value for Lot 1 was 1 indicating no statistically significant findings.
